/**
 * Merges two sorted arrays into a single sorted array.
 * 
 * This function takes two input arrays (arr1 and arr2), which are assumed to already be sorted.
 * It compares the elements from both arrays one by one, and constructs a new array (results) by
 * repeatedly pushing the smaller of the two elements. Once one of the arrays is exhausted,
 * it appends any remaining elements from the other array.
 * 
 * @param {Array} arr1 - The first sorted array to be merged.
 * @param {Array} arr2 - The second sorted array to be merged.
 * @returns {Array} - A new array that contains all the elements from arr1 and arr2, sorted in ascending order.
 * 
 * Notes:
 * - This function assumes that both input arrays are already sorted. If they aren't, you would need to sort them first.

  /**
 * Divide-and-conquer sorting algorithm that sorts an array using the merge sort algorithm. 
 * It takes an unsorted array, splits it, and recursively sorts and merges the halves.
 * 
 * The function recursively splits the input array into two halves until each half has one or zero elements.
 * Then it merges the halves together using the merge function to produce a sorted array.
 * 
 * @param {Array} arr - The array to be sorted.
 * @returns {Array} - A new array containing the elements from arr, sorted in ascending order.
 * 
 * Notes:
 * - Merge Sort is stable, meaning that it preserves the order of equal elements.
 * - This implementation creates new arrays for every split, which can increase memory usage.
