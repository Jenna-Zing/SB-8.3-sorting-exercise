# Sorting Exercise

In this exercise, I will get to practice implementing sorting algorithms. In the starter-code.zip - it includes sort files as well as test files.

I have set up a package.json and installed jest. To run the test files, do `npm i` to install jest. Then run `npm test` to run jest.

# Jenna's Notes:

- \*\*For running the project, `cd dsa-sorting`, then run `node bubble.js` for example - and be sure that inside of the file you're calling - call the function.
- Alternatively, you could run the functions in each file from Node.js REPL interactive shell -> `cd dsa-sorting`, then run `node`, and `const bubbleSort = require('./bubble');` for example. Then you may call `bubbleSort(...)` as you wish.
- \*\*For unit testing, run `npx jest bubble.test.js` for example. Otherwise, run all tests at once using `npm test` in the dsa-sorting directory.
